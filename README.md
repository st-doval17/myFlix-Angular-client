## Development Server

To start the development server, run `ng serve`. This will launch a development server at `http://localhost:4200/`, with automatic reloading when you modify source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Generate project components, such as components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules, using `ng generate component component-name`.

## Build

Compile the project with `ng build`. The build artifacts will be saved in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) using `ng test`.

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end tests, run `ng e2e`. Note that you may need to add a package for end-to-end testing capabilities.
